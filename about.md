Having graduated with a 1st in Computer Science from Nottingham University, I spent the first 5 years of my working life in the Games Industry for [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com) followed by [Criterion Games](http://www.criteriongames.com), before moving into the VFX industry at [The Foundry](http://www.thefoundry.co.uk). After 4 years learning how to make films, I now work at [DeepMind](http://www.deepmind.com) working to 'Solve Intelligence'.

This website is really just somewhere for me to collate all those little projects Iâ€™ve worked on over the years outside of work, which hopefully some might find useful, or even a little interesting! If you want to get in contact, the best way is to send an email to [contactme@tomjbward.co.uk](mailto:contactme@tomjbward.co.uk)
