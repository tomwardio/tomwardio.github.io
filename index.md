# Hello there!

I'm Tom, a Software Engineer from London, UK. Over the years I've had the
privilege to work in various exciting domains, from cutting edge
[games](http://www.criteriongames.com) to the captivating world of
[VFX](http://www.foundry.com). Currently I'm at
[DeepMind](http://www.deepmind.com) doing AI research to "Solve Intelligence".

This site is my quiet corner of the web to collate those projects I've worked on
over the years, which others might find useful, or even a little interesting!

Please feel free to [reach out](contact/) if you'd like to get in contact.
